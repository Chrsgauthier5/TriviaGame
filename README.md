HW5 Trivia Game

I made this game as a way to test your disney knowledge!

The game concept is quite simple - the focus of the project was implementing timers - primarily through setInterval & setTimeout functions.

The game questions are currently static, so the quiz will be the same each time.  I definitely think it could be spiced up by utilizing an API so the questions are new each time.  This would require some revamping of the logic and structure of the game.  If i were to make that improvement i would definitely start from scratch as i think too much would need to be changed.

Give this trivia game a play and see how you score! https://chrsgauthier5.github.io/TriviaGame/
